<h1>Setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux for Development</h1>

<p><em>You must be running Windows 10 to perform this procedure.</em> If you are using a different operating system, check <a href="https://help.learn.co/en/articles/1394611-when-should-i-set-up-a-local-environment">When should I set up a local environment</a> to find out what setup instructions you should follow.</p>

<p><em>Note: It is no longer necessary to enable developer mode for Windows Subsystem Linux to work.</em>  </p>

<h2>Getting Windows Ready</h2>

<p>1) Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is <strong>not</strong> automatically enabled on windows. So, to start off, we need to enable it!    </p>

<pre><code>a. Go to your Windows Search bar and type in `turn windows features on or off`  


b.  Click on the result that matches your query. It will be in your Control Panel.  You should see something like this:    
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.png" alt="toggle windows features">    </p>

<p>c.  Scroll down until you see &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot; - ensure its box is checked!    </p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-turnon.png" alt="wsl checkbox">  </p>

<p>2)  <strong>Restart your computer</strong>
3)  Check your Windows 10 version by going to <code>System Information</code> and checking your Version. If your build is earlier than 16215, skip step 4 and proceed to step 5.<br>
   <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/windows-version.png" alt="windows version">
4)  Open up Microsoft Store. Search for &quot;Ubuntu&quot;
    1) Choose &quot;Ubuntu&quot; (not 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS)  </p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/ubuntu-choice.png" alt="ubuntu choice in microsoft store">    </p>

<p>5) If you run into errors or if you have an early version of Windows 10, see further information  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a>  </p>

<p>6) Open up the Ubuntu app. Follow the prompts, which will include making a username and password. Don&#39;t forget your password!  </p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/open-ubuntu.png" alt="open ubuntu">  </p>

<p>Note: if you get an error at this step, see FAQ below.</p>

<h2>Start Outfitting your new Linux Subsystem: RVM / Ruby, learn-co, git, NodeJS, and Rails</h2>

<p>7) Once everything is set up, we can start setting up our system! Start off by running the following to download our dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>```
sudo apt-get update  
```
```
sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev libpq-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison gnupg postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
</code></pre>

<p>8) Install RVM by running:</p>

<pre><code>```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```
&gt; __Note:__ There are two possible errors you may see at this point. Follow the appropriate instructions below:

&gt; **(A) If** the previous command does not work the first time (with the error `keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr` and/or `IPC connect call failed`, try running it again.
&gt;  If the second time works, you should see public keys imported by Piotr Kuczynski and Michal Papis. You can now continue with the procedure and disregard the rest of the instructions in this shaded area.
&gt;  If the command still does not work (you still get the same errors as the first attempt), then perform the following:
&gt;
&gt; ```
&gt; sudo apt-get install gnupg2 -y
&gt; gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; **(B) If** the original error you get is `[gpg] keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure`, run the following command (following the instructions above if you get the error above):
&gt; ```
&gt; gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net:80 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
&gt; ```

Once you have successfully run either the `gpg` or the `gpg2` command above, run the following:

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```
and finally

```
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```
</code></pre>

<p>9)  Next, to set up a ruby version most compatible with Learn.co labs, we want to download ruby 2.6.1 and set it as our default:</p>

<pre><code>```
rvm install 2.6.1
rvm use 2.6.1 --default
```
</code></pre>

<p>10)  Let&#39;s install the bundler gem:  </p>

<pre><code>    ```
    gem install bundler
    ```
</code></pre>

<p>11) And set up git:</p>

<pre><code>```
git config --global color.ui true
```
For the next few commands, make sure to input your specific information:

```
git config --global user.name &quot;your_name&quot;
```

```
git config --global user.email &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;
```
You can either communicate with your remote repositories via HTTPS or SSH. If you want to use SSH (which means you will not have to authenticate with your GitHub username and password before each push) - [follow these instructions.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
</code></pre>

<p>12) Now we can get set up with the learn-co gem. This will allow you to use commands like <code>learn</code>, <code>learn submit</code>, and <code>learn open</code>.</p>

<pre><code>```
gem install learn-co
```
- In your browser, navigate to learn.co/your_github_username
- At the bottom of the page, you should see text that says `OAuth Token:` followed by a token. Copy the token, and then go back to your WSL terminal
- Type:  
    ```
    learn whoami
    ```
- Paste in your token  

You should now be fully authenticated with learn.
</code></pre>

<p>13) Now let&#39;s get Node Version Manager, NodeJS, and Rails installed so we can make a bunch of stuff!</p>

<pre><code>- First, install NVM:
  ```
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
  ```
- Then, reload bash profile into current session:
  ```
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
- Next, install NodeJS:
  ```
  nvm install node
  ```
- Now, Ruby on Rails:
  ```
  gem install rails
  ```
</code></pre>

<h2>Choose your programming editor: VSCode</h2>

<p>You can use any editor you want, but I am going to be walking through setting up VSCode.</p>

<p>14) Download VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>. Choose the Windows download, not the Linux download. Any required Linux downloads will be done via the Ubuntu terminal, and everything else should be downloaded for your Windows OS.</p>

<p>15) To configure your Ubuntu terminal to be available in VSCode:</p>

<pre><code>- open up VSCode
- open the Command Palette via `F1` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`p`
- begin typing the following: `Terminal: Select Default Shell`  until you see it. Select that option.

![command palette](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/default-shell.png)  

- Once you select it, a few options will pop up. You want to select WSL

![WSL Terminal](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-bash-selection.png)
</code></pre>

<p>16) Now, you can use your Ubuntu terminal in VSCode. Select &quot;New Terminal&quot; in the &quot;Terminal&quot; drop-down, or type <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Shift</code>+` in order to use it!</p>

<p>17) Additional User Settings <em>(OPTIONAL)</em>:
    - You can add a few things to your User Settings to customize and improve your programming experience. Most importantly, we can make VSCode treat .erb files like .html files, allowing us to use all the same shortcuts and get the same syntax highlighting.
    - To open up user settings, again open up the Command Palette using <code>F1</code> or <code>Ctr</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>p</code> and type <code>Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)</code>
    <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/settings-json.png" alt="Preferences - settings">
    - You will see a screen like this:
    <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/user-settings.png" alt="Preferences - settings">
    - to have your erb files treated like html, add the following to your user settings (circled above):
        <code>
        &quot;emmet.includeLanguages&quot;: {
            &quot;erb&quot;: &quot;html&quot;
        }
</code>
    - some optional personal preferences that I like:
        <code>
        &quot;window.zoomLevel&quot;: -1,
        &quot;editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter&quot;: &quot;off&quot;,
        &quot;editor.fontSize&quot;: 11,
        &quot;editor.fontFamily&quot;: &quot;Hack, Consolas, &#39;Courier New&#39;, monospace&quot;,
</code>
    - Note that for the Hack font to be usable, you have to downlload it. You can check it out <a href="https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">here</a>.</p>

<p>18) Update your .learn-config
    - Travel to your Linux home directory by typing <code>cd</code>, you can change your .learn-config by typing:</p>

<pre><code>```
nano .learn-config
```

- and customizing where you want the ```learn open``` command to save labs, and setting your editor to VSCode. Here&#39;s what it should look like:

```
---
:learn_directory: &quot;/mnt/c/users/&lt;your username&gt;/dev/flatiron/labs&quot;
:editor: code
```

- You save a file you have modified in `nano` by following the directions at the bottom of the screen: click `Ctrl`+`X` and then `y` and then `Enter` to save your changes.

- If you feel uncomfortable with these commands, check out the basic Linux commands link below in the resources.

<h2>Important Knowledge: Basic Use</h2>

<p>Your terminal is actually accessing an Ubuntu Virtual Machine which is running inside of your Windows OS. If you ever <code>cd</code> in your terminal, you will be sent to the &#39;user home&#39; of your Linux VM. That is also the default location you will be in when you open your Ubuntu app. You actually want to do all of your business inside of your normal Windows file space, not your Linux VM file space. So, you will need to know how to navigate in your terminal from your Ubuntu file system to your Windows file system. This is pretty simple if you understand how the system is set up, so let&#39;s go over that quickly.</p>

<p>To allow you to access the functionality of a Linux machine, Windows stores the Ubuntu OS and file system inside of its own file system. You should NEVER access your Ubuntu files via your Windows machine. What you SHOULD do is save everything you are working on in your normal Windows filespace, and access that via your Ubuntu terminal. So, how do you do that? Well, from the Ubuntu&#39;s point of view, it is just a normal Linux machine, but Microsoft has made a pathway between the Linux VM and your Windows OS via the <code>/mnt</code> directory in your Ubuntu&#39;s root.</p>

<p>Here is a quick visual of what the first few levels of any Linux filesystem look like:<br>
<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs.png" alt="linux file system"></p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>mnt</code> directory is made for other filesystems, so that is where Microsoft connected your Linux to your Windows machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs_path.png" alt="linux file system"></p>

<p>So, you can get there from your starting point by typing:</p>

<pre><code>cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
</code></pre>

<p>or
<code>
cd ../../mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
</code></p>

<p>Remember, put all of your stuff in your windows directories! That way, you have access to it via your Linux Terminal or your Windows OS, and your VSCode editor can open to the correct location when you use
<code>
code .
</code>
(if you are in your Linux file system, VSCode will open, but not to the right spot).</p>

<h2>Adding A Flatiron Customization To Your Terminal</h2>

<p>Start out by making a backup for your <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>mv .bashrc .bashrc.bak
</code></pre>

<p>We will want a tool for converting Windows ending to Unix endings for our new <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install dos2unix
</code></pre>

<p>download the new <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>curl -R &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enoch2k2/flatiron-wsl-bashrc/master/.bashrc&quot; &gt;&gt; $HOME/.bashrc
</code></pre>

<p>We&#39;ll use our converter to convert our bashrc to use the right unix endings:</p>

<pre><code>dos2unix .bashrc
</code></pre>

<h2>Set up a directory for all of your labs</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that we set up our <code>.learn-config</code> file earlier with a path destination of <code>/mnt/c/users/&lt;your_windows_username&gt;/dev/flatiron/labs</code>. The <code>.bashrc</code> file we just downloaded gives us a really nice way to access that folder quickly by just typing in <code>labs</code> when we pull up our WSL terminal (or anytime you want to access that folder - it doesn&#39;t matter what directory you are currently in when you type it). In order for this to work, we need to make sure that these directories exist. To do this, begin by navigating to your <code>windows home</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&#39;s make the appropriate files. Run these one at a time, and do it without copying and pasting. Remember the basic bash commands: <code>cd</code> changes directories to whatever folder you type in and <code>mkdir</code> creates a new directory which will be a subdirectory of the current directory location of your terminal.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir dev
cd dev
mkdir flatiron
cd flatiron
mkdir labs
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have the directories you need, and you should have seen yourself navigating down your new file tree as you made each new directory and then <code>cd</code>&#39;d into it.</p>

<p>Now, <code>learn open</code> should work seamlessly by adding your most current lab to the <code>labs</code> directory we just made.</p>

<p>Also, you should be able to run the command
<code>
labs
</code>
at any time in your terminal and you will be taken to your <code>labs</code>  directory. Give it a try!</p>

<h2>Phantomjs</h2>

<p>In the Javascript section of the Flatiron curriculum, some tests require phantomjs. If you run across an error related to phantomjs, do the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath libssl-dev libxft-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libfontconfig1-dev -y
cd ~
export PHANTOM_JS=&quot;phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64&quot;
wget https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs/releases/download/v2.1.1/$PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo tar xvjf $PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo mv $PHANTOM_JS /usr/local/share
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/share/$PHANTOM_JS/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin
phantomjs --version
</code></pre>

<h2>Advanced topics: PostgreSQL setup (OPTIONAL)</h2>

<p><strong>Setting up PostgreSQL allows simple production-level database integration into a Rails project. This allows easy hosting on Heroku with only a little setup.</strong></p>

<p>1) First, we want to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/">Download PostgreSQL for Windows</a> - download the Interactive Installer.
2) Once everything is downloaded and installed, you can verify proper operation by typing in your terminal</p>

<pre><code>```
psql -p 5432 -h localhost -U postgres
```
once connection is verified, you can quit by typing
```
\q
```
</code></pre>

<p>3) There are a few ways to do the next few steps but the easiest way is to use pgAdmin. Open up pgAdmin, which is a Graphical User Interface for PostgreSQL.</p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-start.png" alt="PGAdmin in start"></p>

<ul>
<li>This should open up pgAdmin in your browser. Start a server by right-clicking &quot;PostgreSQL&quot; and selecting &quot;Connect Server&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/start-server.png" alt="PostgreSQL selection">
<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/connect-server.png" alt="PostgreSQL connect"></p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the password you defined during the download</li>
<li>Your PostgreSQL server is running, and can now be integrated into your projects.</li>
<li>You also want to set up a new user/role and password that you want to use with your rails app. Ensure you give your user/role all available permissions during setup.

<ul>
<li>During setup, ensure to fill out <code>Name</code> in the <code>General</code> tab, <code>Password</code> in the <code>Definition</code> tab, and enable all permissions in the <code>Privileges</code> tab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-create-user.png" alt="create user">  </p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/create-user-permissions.png" alt="create user permissions"></p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE: CONNECTING YOUR POSTGRESQL SERVER TO YOUR RAILS APP</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your server is connected and roles are configured as described above.</li>
<li><p>Make sure you are in a suitable directory (in your Windows file system space) and create a Rails app configured to use PostgreSQL:
<code>
rails new my-first-app --database=postgresql
</code>    </p>

<ul>
<li>Now, let&#39;s configure our <code>database.yml</code> file to allow our app to connect to our database. Add the following to your <code>config/database.yml</code> file under BOTH <code>development:</code> and <code>test:</code> You will need to add a user and password which will correspond to the roles we created in pgAdmin.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>host: localhost
user: your-postgres-username
password: your-postgres-usernames-password
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We can now test our database and rails interoperability by first setting up some architecture in our app:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>now create and migrate a database:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>rake db:create
rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If these fail, ensure you have added your database.yml configurations under both the development AND test sections</li>
<li>Now, start a server:
<code>
rails s
</code></li>
<li>If you navigate to <code>localhost:3000</code> you should see that we are on Rails!<br>
<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/on-rails.png" alt="on Rails"></li>
<li>Let&#39;s test our database by going to &#39;localhost:3000/posts&#39;<br>
<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/posts.png" alt="posts"></li>
<li>Now just follow the crud links and try to make a post! We should be seeing our database working great with our rails app!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/database-works.png" alt="database works"></p>

<ul>
<li>Hopefully, everything is working for you! Now you&#39;re ready to develop using WSL!</li>
</ul>
